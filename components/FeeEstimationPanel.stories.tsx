 * FeeEstimationPanel stories.
 *
 * The component's only public prop is `active: boolean`.
 * When active=true it fires a simulated Soroban RPC call (~800–1200 ms)
 * and self-transitions through loading → success (or error).
 *
 * - **Active (loading → success)**: Set active=true and watch it resolve.
 * - **Inactive**: Set active=false — the panel renders nothing.
 *
 * Because the component manages its own async state internally, each story
 * shows a "live" panel that transitions on its own after ~1 second.
 * Use the Controls addon to toggle `active` on/off to restart the simulation.
